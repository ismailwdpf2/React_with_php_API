    <h4>MRF Tyres ICC Player Rankings</h4>
    The MRF Tyres ICC Player Rankings is a table where international cricket players performances are ranked using a points based system which is worked out by doing a series of calculations leading to a sophisticated moving average. Players are rated on a scale of 0 to 1000 points. If a player’s performance is improving on his past record, his points increase; if his performance is declining his points will go down. The value of each player’s performance within a match is calculated using an algorithm, a series of calculations (all pre-programmed) based on various circumstances in the match. There is no human intervention in this calculation process, and no subjective assessment is made. There are slightly different factors for each of the different formats of the game.

    The MRF Tyres ICC Team Rankings is a rating method developed by David Kendix to rank men’s teams playing across Test, One-Day International and Twenty20 International formats and women’s teams playing One-Day International and Twenty20 International cricket. This rating is worked out by dividing the points scored by the match/series total, with the answer given to the nearest whole number. It can be compared with a batting average, but with points instead of total runs scored and a match/series total instead of number of times dismissed.

    <b>Women’s Team Rankings</b> <br/>
    The MRF Tyres ICC Women’s Team Rankings are similar to the men’s rankings, calculated separately for ODIs and T20Is.
    <br/>
   
    <p>  In all, 10 teams are ranked in the MRF Tyres ICC Women’s ODI Team Rankings while the MRF Tyres ICC Women’s T20I Team Rankings lists all Members who meet the eligibility criteria for matches played. This follows the recent decision to grant T20I status to all matches between the 104 ICC Members and the USA.
    
    The annual updates take place on 1 October each year. </p>
